R code to collect data from various sources on the 2020 George Floyd protests.

For now, it just has:

- a [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_George_Floyd_protests) scraper.
- a [twitter thread puller](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1267297607782731777) that's been documenting brutality incidents
- `data/links-to-preserve.txt` which `nikisweeting/archivebox` (docker) is run daily on so PR into that file or file an issue so I can.
